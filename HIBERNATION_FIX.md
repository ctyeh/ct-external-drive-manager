# Hibernation Recovery Fix

## Issue
Auto-mount system failed after hibernation because the sleepwatcher service was not running, causing the external drive to be forcibly disconnected during hibernation without safe ejection.

## Root Cause
- Sleepwatcher LaunchAgent service was not installed/running
- Drive remained mounted during automatic hibernation
- File system corruption occurred due to unsafe disconnection
- Mount attempts failed on wake-up

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Installed sleepwatcher LaunchAgent service
2. ✅ Configured passwordless sudo for safe operations
3. ✅ Tested safe ejection before hibernation
4. ✅ Tested automatic remounting after wake-up
5. ✅ Verified complete hibernation-safe operation

## Files Added/Modified
- `config/com.user.ctexternaldisk.sleepwatcher.plist` - LaunchAgent service
- Enhanced hibernation safety documentation

## Result
System now properly handles automatic hibernation with safe drive ejection and recovery.
